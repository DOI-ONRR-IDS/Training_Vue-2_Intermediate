# Training - Vue 2 - Intermediate

## Instructions

Fork this repository into your own account and clone it to your local machine.

This project will give you a small "Todo" application to build in Vue, using the tools learned from the official VueJS docs. It uses a CDN version of Vue and a single HTML file, so you don't need to mess around with build tools. This also means you shouldn't try to use `Single File Component` or other topics covered in the Vue docs that require transpiling.

## Resources

- [VueJS Docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)
- [Vue DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)

## Objectives

- Read through the `Components Basics` and `Transitions & Animation` portions of the Vue docs and follow along with the `/index.html` file. You should be able to just open the file in your browser to run it. eg: `file:///C:/Users/{UserID}/Desktop/Training_Vue-2_Intermediate/index.html`

- Use the tools learned in the Vue docs to expand the `/index.html` file into a full "Todo" app.
